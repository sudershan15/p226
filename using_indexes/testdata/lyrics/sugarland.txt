All I Want To Do lyrics

I don't want to get up baby, let's turn off the phone
I don't want to go to work today or even put my makeup on
I got better things to do than my to do list anyway
Hide under the covers and waste away the day

Let's just lay here and be lazy, baby drive me crazy

All I want to do-o-o-o
All I want to do-o-o-o is love you, yeah

I got my whole life to change the world and climb the ladders
Looking at you looking at me is the only thing that matters
Come a little closer baby, we can talk without the words
Hang a sign on the door, please do not disturb

Let's just lay here and be lazy, baby drive me crazy

All I want to do-o-o-o
All I want to do-o-o-o is love you

Give me a kiss from that Elvis lip
You don't want to miss this!

All I want to do-o-o-o
All I want to do-o-o-o is love you

All I really want to do is
All I really want to do is
All I really want to do is love you and love you and love you

Come a little closer baby, we can talk without the words
Hang a sign on the door
Please do not, please do not, please do not, please do not disturb

When I lay down in the evening all I really want to do is
When I wake up, when I wake up in the morning baby
All I really want to do is
