Save Me San Francisco lyrics
Songwriters: Hollander, Sam; Katz, David; Monahan, Pat;

I used to love the tenderloin until I made some tender coin
Then I met some ladies from Marin
We took the highway to the one up the coast to catch some sun
That left me with these blisters on my skin

Don't know what I was on but I think it grows in Oregon
So I kept on going, going on right through
I drove into Seattle rain, fell in love then missed the train
That could have took me right back home to you

I've been high, I've been low
I've been yes and I've been oh, hell no
I've been rock 'n' roll and disco
Won't you save me San Francisco?

Every day so caffeinated, I wish they were Golden Gated
Fillmore couldn't feel more miles away
So wrap me up return to sender, let's forget this five year bender
Take me to my city by the bay

I never knew all that I had, now Alcatraz don't sound so bad
At least they have a hell of a fine Merlot
If I could wish upon a star I would hitch a cable car
To the place that I can always call my own

I've been high, I've been low
I've been yes and I've been oh, hell no
I've been rock 'n' roll and disco
Won't you save me San Francisco?

I've been up, I've been down
I've been so damn lost since you're not around
I've been reggae and calypso
Won't you save me San Francisco?

To tell you the truth I miss everything, everything
It's a wild, wild beautiful world
But there's a wide eyed girl back there
And she means everything, everything

I've been stop, I've been go
I've been yes and I've been oh, hell no
I've been rock 'n' roll and disco
Won't you save me San Francisco?

I've been up, I've been down
I've been so damn lost since you're not around
I've been reggae and calypso
Won't you save me San Francisco?

Save me San Francisco
Won't you save me San Francisco?
Save me San Francisco
Won't you save me San Francisco?
