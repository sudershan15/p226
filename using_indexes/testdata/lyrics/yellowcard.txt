Drifting lyrics


When I look into your eyes
I can see
Such a sad man in disguise
Dreaming, wishing, waiting, drifting from me
Oh I can see
Hurts my heart to see you cry
Dreaming, wishing, waiting, drifting from me
I don't know you anymore
Wish I knew what's wrong
Can't we try to slam that door
start a brand new song
now...

I know you're lonely and you cry
wondering why
I know it's lonely but if once
You could help me understand
What it takes to be a man
Look back on what you've said
and the life you've led
Is it what you dreamed when you were young like me...
ha ha ha

Now it's time
You took something back
just for the sake of your mind
just for the sake of your mind
just for the sake of your mind

When I look into your eyes
I can see
Life has buried you alive
Dreaming, wishing, waiting, drifting from me
You can't breathe
Hurts my heart to see you cry
Dreaming, wishing, waiting, drifting from me
