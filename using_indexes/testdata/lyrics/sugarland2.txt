We Run lyrics
Songwriters: Bush, Kristian; Carusoe, Scooter; Nettles, Jennifer;

Snake oil and roses, pockets of dirt
Hands of a fortune teller's son
Young love shakin' the earth
Like a heart shot out of a gun

Lips like gravity pull me under
Reckless weather on his breath
Smells like rain, hits like thunder
Storm is comin', I got nothin' left

So we run, yeah, yeah, yeah, we run
Come undone like a string on a sweater
That you pull but you know better
But doing what you shouldn'ts half the fun
So we run

Fire and laughter, fence posts flyin'
Feel the fever in the air
Can't remember what came before him
And what comes after I don't care

Hands are tremblin', swore I wouldn't
One more look and I'll give in
Hundred reasons why I shouldn't
But I lost my heart and wanted him to win

So we run, yeah, yeah, yeah, we run
Come undone like a string on a sweater
Old enough and should know better
But doin' what you shouldn'ts half the fun
So we run

I hear the lever on his voice, it's a callin' not a choice
And I can't keep myself from followin' the sound
Yeah, you may never know how fast that you can go
Till someone lifts your feet up off the ground

So we run, yeah, yeah, yeah, we run
Come undone, yeah, yeah, yeah, undone
So we run, yeah, yeah, yeah, we run
So we run, yeah, yeah, yeah, we run, yeah
