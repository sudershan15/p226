Honey, honey, how you thrill me, ah, hah, honey, honey
Honey, honey, nearly kill me, ah, hah, honey, honey
I'd heard about you before, I wanted to know some more
And now I know what they mean, you're a love machine
Oh, you make me dizzy

Honey, honey, let me feel it, ah, ha, honey, honey
Honey, honey, don't conceal it, ah ha, honey, honey
The way that you kiss goodnight, the way that you hold me tight
I feel like I wanna sing when you do your thing

I don't wanna hurt you, baby, I don't wanna see you cry
So stay on the ground, girl, you better not get too high
But I'm gonna stick to you, boy, you'll never get rid of me
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be

Honey, honey, touch me, baby, ah, hah, honey, honey
Honey, honey, hold me, baby, ah, hah, honey, honey
You look like a movie star, but I know just who you are
And, honey, to say the least, you're a doggone beast

So stay on the ground, girl, you better not get too high
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be

Honey, honey, how you thrill me, ah, hah, honey, honey
Honey, honey, nearly kill me, ah, hah, honey, honey
I'd heard about you before, I wanted to know some more
And now I know what they mean, you're a love machine
Oh, you make me dizzy
