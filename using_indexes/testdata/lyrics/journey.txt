Highway run
Into the midnight sun
Wheels go round and round
You're on my mind
Restless hearts sleep alone tonight
Sendin' all my love along the wire
They say that the road ain't no place to start a family
Right down the line it's been you and me
And lovin' a music man ain't always what it's s'posed 
to be
Oh girl, ya stand by me
I'm forever yours...
-Faithfully

Circus life under the big-top world
We all need the clowns to make us smile
Through space and time
Always another shore
Wonderin' where I am
Lost without you
And bein' apart ain't easy on this love affair
Two strangers learn to fall in love again
I get the joy of rediscoverin' you
Oh girl, you stand by me
I'm forever yours
-Faithfully

Whoa oh oh oh, Whoa oh oh oh, Whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Faithfully, I'm still yours
I'm still yours...Faithfully
