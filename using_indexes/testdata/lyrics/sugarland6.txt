They say in this town, stars stay up all night
Well, I don't know, can't see 'em for the glow of the neon lights
An' it's a long way from here to the place where the home fires burn
Well it's two thousand miles and one left turn

Dear Mom and Dad
Please send money, I'm so broke that it ain't funny
Well, I don't need much, just enough to get me through
Please don't worry 'cause I'm all right
See, I'm playin' here at the bar tonight
Well, this time I'm gonna make our dreams come true
Well, I love you more than anything in the world
Love, your baby girl

Black Top, blue sky, big town full of little white lies
Well, everybody's your friend, you can never be sure
They'll promise fancy cars an' diamond rings an' all sorts of shiny things
But, girl, you'll remember what your knees are for

Dear Mom and Dad
Please send money, I'm so broke that it ain't funny
Well, I don't need much, just enough to get me through
Please don't worry 'cause I'm all right
See, I'm playin' here at the bar tonight
Well, this time I'm gonna make our dreams come true
Well, I love you more than anything in the world
Love, your baby girl

I know that I'm on my way
Well, I can tell every time I play
An' I know it's worth all the dues I pay
When I can write to you and say

Dear Mom and Dad
I'll send money, I'm so rich that it ain't funny
Well it ought to be more than enough to get you through
Please don't worry 'cause I'm all right
See, I'm stayin' here at the Ritz tonight
Whaddya know, we made our dreams come true

An' there are fancy cars an' diamond rings
But you know that they don't mean a thing
Well, they all add up to nothin' compared to you
Well, remember me in ribbons an' curls
I still love you more than anything in the world
Love, your baby girl, ah yeah

(Your baby girl)
Dear Mom and Dad
Please send money, I'm so broke that it ain't funny
Don't need much, just enough to get me through
(Your baby girl)
Please don't worry 'cause I'm all right
Playin' here at the bar tonight
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Dreams come true
