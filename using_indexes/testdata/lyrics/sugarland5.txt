Already Gone lyrics
Songwriters: Bush, Kristian; Nettles, Jennifer; Pinson, Bobby;



My mama mapped out the road that she knows
Which hands you shake and which hands you hold
In my hand-me-down Mercury, ready to roll
She knew that I had to go

And hangout, make lots of noise
And lay out late with a boy
Make the mistakes that she made
'Cause she knew all along

I was already goneI was already gone
I was already gone
Life is a runaway train you can't wait to jump on

They say the first time won't ever last
But that didn't stop me, the first time he laughed
All my friends tried to warn me the day that we met
Girl don't you lost your heart yet

But his dark eyes dared me with danger
And sparks fly like flame to a paper
Fire in his touch burning me up
But still I held on

'Cause I was already gone, I was already gone
I was already gone
Life is a runaway train you can't wait to jump on

The last time I saw him, we packed up my things
And he smiled like the first time he told me his name
And we cried with each other
We split the blame for the parts that we couldn't change

Pictures, dishes and socks
It's our whole life down to one box
There he was waving goodbye
On the front porch alone

But I was already gone, I was already gone
I was already gone
I was already gone, I was already gone

Hangout, make lots of noise
And layout late with a boy
Make the mistakes that she made
Life is a runaway train

My mama mapped out the road that she knows
Which hands to shake, which hands you hold
In my hand-me-down Mercury
Life is a runaway train you can't wait to jump on
