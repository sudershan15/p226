Love lyrics
Songwriters: Bush, Kristian; Nettles, Jennifer; Owens, Tim;

Is it the face of a child? Is it the thrill of danger?
Is it the kindness we see in the eyes of a stranger?
Is it more than faith? Is it more than hope?
Is it waiting for us at the end of our rope?

I say it's love!
I say it's love!

Is it the one you call home? Is it the Holy Land?
Is it standing right here holding your hand?
Is it just like the movies? Is it rice and white lace?
Is it the feeling I get when I wake to your face?

I say it's love!
I say it's love!

Is it the first summer storm? Is it the colors of fall?
Is it having so little and yet having it all?
Is it one in a million? Is it a chance to belong?
Is it standing right here singing this song?

I say it's love
I say it's love

(I say it's love!)
Is it a veil or a cross? Is it the poet's gift?
(I say it's love!)
Is it the face that has launched over thousands of ships?

(I say it's love!)
Is it making you laugh? Is it letting you cry?
(I say it's love!)
Is it where we believe that we go when we die?

(I say it's love!)
Is it how you were made? Is it your mother's ghost?
(I say it's love!)
Is it the wish that I'm wishing for your life
For your life, for your life the most?
