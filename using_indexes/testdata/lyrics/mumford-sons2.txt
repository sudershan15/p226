Little Lion Man lyrics

Weep for yourself, my man, 
You'll never be what is in your heart
Weep little lion man, 
You're not as brave as you were at the start
Rate yourself and rake yourself, 
Take all the courage you have left
Wasted on fixing all the problems that you made in your own head

(chorus)

But it was not your fault but mine
and it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear? didn't i my 

Tremble for yourself, my man, 
You know that you have seen this all before
Tremble little lion man, 
You'll never settle any of your score
Your grace is wasted in your face, 
Your boldness stands alone among the wreck
now learn from your mother or else I spend your days biting 
your own neck

(chorus 2x)

But it was not your fault but mine
and it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
didn't I, my dear? (second time) didn't I my dear?

ah ah (multi)

(chorus)

But it was not your fault but mine
and it was your heart on the line 
I really fucked it up this time
didn't i my dear?

(chorus above it)
