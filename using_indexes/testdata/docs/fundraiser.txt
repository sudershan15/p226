The family of a young San Jose woman who suffered a traumatic brain injury in a car accident two years ago is holding 
a benefit concert Saturday to raise money for her ongoing rehabilitation.

The Christian rock concert is for 19-year-old Jessica Huse, who has been mostly confined to a bed or wheelchair since 
her accident in the summer 2009.

Her parents, Lisa and Don Huse, hope to raise at least $100,000 to pay for travel, living and medical expenses for 
the next year, as her specialized doctors hope to fly her out to New Jersey where she could live for a while.

"I have faith we'll raise that money," Lisa Huse said. "The response for Jessica has been pretty amazing."

That's so she can be under the constant care of Dr. Philip DeFina, the CEO of the International Brain Research 
Foundation in New Jersey, and who will now be running a specialized neurological department at Meadowlands Hospital 
and Rehabilitation. Insurance doesn't cover any of DeFina's therapies.

Last year, the Huse family held a fundraiser at Valley Christian School to raise money to get Jessica into DeFina's 
program. They raised nearly $100,000. Her parent are now divorced, but they share the responsibility of wheeling 
Jessica to church, massaging her muscles and administering her medicines and vitamins. Don Huse is a mortgage 
lender. Lisa Huse teaches new parent skills at Good Samaritan Hospital. They also take turns raising their son,
Trent, now 14, a student at Valley Christian.
 
Since being accepted into DeFina's program, where his team has visited her in San Jose, Lisa Huse said her daughter's 
tests showed between a 15 to 20 percent increase in brain activity. Her condition was upgraded from a "vegetative" 
state to a "semiconscious emerging" state.

But Jessica needs more.

Lisa Huse is the first to admit that the progress for Jessica, once a bright, bubbly and spiritual teen, is 
"slow going." Jessica still doesn't speak, but she's beginning to make sounds and sometimes smile, her mother said. 
Last year, she had been to Twin Oaks Church just once. Now, she goes nearly every Sunday.

Lisa Huse is hopeful that by sending her daughter to New Jersey, she'll have full access to the brain research 
foundation doctors and neurological equipment such as a "magnetic stimulator." She'll also have round-the-clock 
speech, physical and occupational therapy available to her.

"You don't get that here," Lisa Huse said. "It's just maintenance. This is our only option."
