Around 169,000 pogo sticks have been voluntarily recalled due to a risk of serious injury, the government said on 
Wednesday.

The Consumer Product Safety Commission said in a statement that 123 incidents involving the sticks have been reported 
to California-based Bravo Sports, including nine reports of injuries. Those included facial laceration and chipped 
and knocked out teeth.

The pogo stick's frame tube and a pin holding the spring can break, posing laceration and fall hazards, the CPSC said.
Recalled pogo sticks include the Rocket Stick Pogo, Pop Stick Pogo, Monster Stick Pogo and Twin Stick Pogo with 
manufacturing date codes between 04/01/2010 - 046HE and 10/31/2010 - 046HE, which can be found on a white label 
near the foot pedals.

The problematic pogos were sold at mass merchandisers nationwide and online between May 2010 and this month.
Consumers should stop using the toy and contact Bravo Sports to receive a full refund, the CPSC said.
